# Data in the Cloud

The cloud supports a vibrant "database as service" ecosystem, with myriad options ranging from traditional RDMBSs to various NoSQL implementations. These services make it easy, affordable, and quick to build legitimate data driven applications that are capable of rapid scalability without deep operational expertise. 

In this hands-on workshop, we will go over the options available for leveraging a number of NoSQL data stores including [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/), [Redis](http://redis.io/), and [Amazon's DynamoDB](http://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/). Whats more, we'll also look at more traditional relational database options available to you in the cloud. You will learn how to work with these datastores, the pros and cons of each datastore type, and what service providers are available to you. With this knowledge, you'll be armed with the information needed to build the next killer app!


## Let's get started! 

This workshop is organized into 3 labs. We don't have a lot of time, so I strongly suggest you pair with someone. People with OSX, please volunteer to be pairing partners as it'll reduce friction because I'm also on OSX. That is, if you have Windows or Linux and someone near you is on a MacBook, then you should probably ask to pair with that person as my directions are tailored to OSX. 

Keep in mind, at least one person will need access to email as creating an account in Heroku uses a two phased authorization for account creation. That is, you'll need to click on a link in an email Heroku sends to you.

### Lab #1

In [Lab #1](/labs/lab_1/README.md), you'll be setting up your environment. You'll create a free Heroku account and download Heroku Toolbelt. Finally, you'll create a Heroku app. 


### Lab #2

In [Lab #2](/labs/lab_2/README.md), you'll deploy a sample app to Heroku. 

### Lab #3

In [Lab #3](/labs/lab_3/README.md), you'll get to know the `heroku` command a bit better and we'll check out a few Heroku add-ons.
